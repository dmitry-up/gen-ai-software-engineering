"""Agent 4 of the pipeline: **Settlement Processor**.

Settles transactions that have cleared validation, fraud and compliance.
A transaction is settled only when it is ``validated``, **not** high-risk
(``flagged``) and **not** on ``compliance_hold``. Anything else is left for
review and passes through unchanged.

All money math uses :class:`~decimal.Decimal` with ``ROUND_HALF_UP`` so the
fee and settled amount are deterministic to the cent.
